        "Questions 1-11 are based on the following passage: \"Studies have shown that employees are happier, 1 healthier, and more productive when they work in an environment 2 in which temperatures are carefully controlled. New buildings may be designed with these studies in mind, but many older buildings were not, resulting in spaces that often depend primarily on artificial lighting. While employers may balk at the expense of reconfiguring such buildings to increase the amount of natural light, the investment has been shown to be well worth it in the long run—for both employees and employers. For one thing, lack of exposure to natural light has a significant impact on employees’ health. A study conducted in 2013 by Northwestern University in Chicago showed that inadequate natural light could result in eye strain, headaches, and fatigue, as well as interference with the body’s circadian rhythms. 3 Circadian rhythms, which are controlled by the 4 bodies biological clocks, influence body temperature, hormone release, cycles of sleep and wakefulness, and other bodily functions. Disruptions of circadian rhythms have been linked to sleep disorders, diabetes, depression. Like any other health problems, these ailments can increase employee absenteeism, which, in turn, 5 is costly for employers. Employees who feel less than 100 percent and are sleep deprived are also less prone to work at their maximal productivity. One company in California 6 gained a huge boost in its employees’ morale when it moved from an artificially lit distribution facility to one with natural illumination. 7 Artificial light sources are also costly aside from lowering worker productivity. They typically constitute anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of a building’s energy use. When a plant in Seattle, Washington, was redesigned for more natural light, the company was able to enjoy annual electricity cost reductions of $500,000 8 each year. Among the possibilities to reconfigure a building’s lighting is the installation of full-pane windows to allow the greatest degree of sunlight to reach office interiors. 9 Thus, businesses can install light tubes, 10 these are pipes placed in workplace roofs to capture and funnel sunlight down into a building’s interior. Glass walls and dividers can also be used to replace solid walls as a means 11 through distributing natural light more freely. Considering the enormous costs of artificial lighting, both in terms of money and productivity, investment in such improvements should be a natural choice for businesses\"",

        "Questions 23-33 are based on the following passage and supplementary material.  \n \"Marketed as SmartFresh, the chemical 1-MCP (1-methylcyclopropene) has been used by fruit growers since 2002 in the United States and elsewhere to preserve the crispness and lengthen the storage life of apples and other fruit, which often must travel long distances before being eaten by consumers. 23 1-MCP lengthens storage life by three to four times when applied to apples. This extended life allows producers to sell their apples in the off-season, months after the apples have been harvested. And at a cost of about one cent per pound of apples, 1-MCP is a highly cost-effective treatment. However, 1-MCP is not a panacea for fruit producers or sellers: there are problems and limitations associated with its use. [1] 1-MCP works by limiting a fruit’s production of ethylene, 24 it is a chemical that causes fruit to ripen and eventually rot. [2] While 1-MCP keeps apples 25 tight and crisp for months, it also limits 26 their scent production. [3] This may not be much of a problem with certain kinds of apples that are not naturally very fragrant, such as Granny Smith, but for apples that are prized for their fruity fragrance, such as McIntosh, this can be a problem with consumers, 27 that will reject apples lacking the expected aroma. [4] But some fruits do not respond as well to 1-MCP as others 28 did, and some even respond adversely. [5] Furthermore, some fruits, particularly those that naturally produce a large  amount of ethylene, do not respond as well to 1-MCP treatment. [6] Take Bartlett 29 pears, for instance, unless they are treated with exactly the right amount of 1-MCP at exactly the right time, they will remain hard and green until they rot, and consumers who experience this will be unlikely to purchase them again. 30 Finally, researchers have found that 1-MCP actually increases susceptibility to some pathologies in certain apple varieties. For example, Empire apples are prone to a condition that causes the flesh of the apple to turn brown. Traditionally, apple producers have dealt with this problem by leaving the apples in the open air for three weeks before storing them in a controlled atmosphere with tightly regulated temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels. As the graph shows, the flesh of untreated Empire apples that are first stored in the open air undergoes 31 roughly five percent less browning than the flesh of untreated Empire apples that are immediately put into storage in a controlled environment. However, when Empire apples are treated with 1-MCP, 32 their flesh turns brown when the apples are first stored in the open air, though not under other conditions. Although researchers continue to search for the right combination of factors that will keep fruits fresh and attractive, 33 the problem may be that consumers are overly concerned with superficial qualities rather than the actual freshness of the fruit.\"",

        "Questions 34-44 are based on the following passage.  \"From Michelangelo’s David to Vincent van Gogh’s series of self-portraits to Grant Wood’s iconic image of a farming couple in American 34 Gothic. These works by human artists have favored representations of members of their own species to those of other species. Indeed, when we think about animals depicted in well-known works of art, the image of dogs playing poker—popularized in a series of paintings by American artist C. M. 35 Coolidge, may be the first and only one that comes to mind. Yet some of the earliest known works of art, including paintings and drawings tens of thousands of years old found on cave walls in Spain and France, 36 portrays animals. Nor has artistic homage to our fellow creatures entirely died out in the millennia since, 37 despite the many years that have passed between then and now. [1] The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, one of Russia’s greatest art museums, has long had a productive partnership with a much loved animal: the cat. [2] For centuries, cats have guarded this famous museum, ridding it of mice, rats, and other rodents that could damage the art, not to mention 38 scared off visitors. [3] Peter the Great introduced the first cat to the Hermitage in the early eighteenth century. [4] Later Catherine the Great declared the cats to be official guardians of the galleries. [5] Continuing the tradition, Peter’s daughter Elizaveta introduced the best and strongest cats in Russia to the Hermitage. [6] Today, the museum holds a yearly festival honoring these faithful workers. 39 These cats are so cherished by the museum that officials recently 40 decreed original paintings to be made of six of them. In each, a cat is depicted upright in a humanlike pose and clothed in imperial-era Russian attire. The person chosen for this 41 task, digital artist, Eldar Zakirov painted the cats in the style traditionally used by portrait artists, in so doing 42 presenting the cats as noble individuals worthy of respect. One portrait, The Hermitage Court Chamber Herald Cat, includes an aristocratic tilt of feline ears as well as a stately sweep of tail emerging from the stiff scarlet and gold of royal court dress. The wise, thoughtful green eyes of the subject of The Hermitage Court Outrunner Cat mimic those of a trusted royal advisor. 43 Some may find it peculiar to observe cats portrayed in formal court poses, but these felines, by 44 mastering the art of killing mice and rats, are benefactors of the museum as important as any human.\"",
